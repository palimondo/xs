  xs_usage_compliance: 100%  # All models avoided BUG-002, used --full
  findings_file: findings/crh-model-comparison.yaml
  recommendation: |
    Use Haiku for focused mining tasks.
    Use Sonnet for complex extraction.
    Reserve Opus for synthesis.

next_action: |
  Begin Pass 2: Story Mining. Start with jsonl-parsing epic.
  Spawn Haiku subagents to search day logs and sessions.
  Reference xs-usage-best-practices.md for agent prompts.
  Note: context epic already has findings from validation test.
