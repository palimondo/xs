# Theme: Console Replay

id: console-replay
name: Session Replay and Reconstruction
description: |
  Reproduce Claude Code console output faithfully so it can be fed to
  other LLMs (like Gemini) for summarization. Console fidelity is critical
  because the output must be parseable by another AI.

motivation: |
  Cross-LLM workflow: Run Claude Code -> Use xs to fetch/replay session ->
  Feed output to Gemini -> Get high-level summary stored in claude-dev-log-diary/.

  The output must match Claude Code's console appearance closely enough that
  another LLM can understand the session content, tool usage, and conversation flow.

primary_use_cases:
  - Generate session transcript for Gemini summarization
  - Document what happened in a session for future reference
  - Share session output with collaborators

key_capabilities:
  - Match Claude Code console symbols exactly
  - Preserve message ordering and tool execution flow
  - Support multiple display modes (compact, truncated, full)
  - Remove interactive-only elements (not meaningful in transcript)

quality_attributes:
  - Fidelity to Claude Code console appearance
  - Parseability by other LLMs
  - Human readability
