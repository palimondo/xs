# Theme: Local Session Exploration

id: local-exploration
name: Local Session Exploration
description: |
  Search, filter, and analyze session transcripts for debugging,
  context recovery, and understanding what happened in past sessions.

motivation: |
  Local Claude Code sessions are stored as JSONL files but are difficult
  to read directly. xs provides a CLI interface for interactive exploration
  with filtering, searching, and multiple display modes.

primary_use_cases:
  - Debug why a session went wrong
  - Find specific tool calls or messages
  - Understand conversation flow
  - Extract specific parts of a session
  - Analyze tool usage patterns

key_capabilities:
  - Session discovery by fuzzy matching
  - Timeline view with chronological ordering
  - Filtering by tool type, message type, patterns
  - Full-text search with context
  - Range selection (first N, last N, specific ranges)
  - Multiple display modes
  - Export to JSON/JSONL for further processing

common_queries:
  - "What did the user actually ask for?"
  - "What tools did Claude use?"
  - "Show the conversation around this error"
  - "What files were modified?"
  - "Find all git operations"
