# Theme: GitHub Fetch

id: github-fetch
name: GitHub Actions Session Recovery
description: |
  Recover Claude Code session transcripts from GitHub Actions CI runs
  where you cannot copy from terminal. Original raison d'etre for xs.

motivation: |
  When Claude Code runs in GitHub Actions (via claude-code-action), the
  session transcript is embedded in workflow logs. Users need to extract
  these sessions for debugging, analysis, or replay.

primary_use_cases:
  - Fetch session from failed CI run to debug what went wrong
  - Recover session from successful run for documentation
  - Extract multiple sessions from a workflow for comparison

key_capabilities:
  - Discover sessions by run ID, issue number, PR number, or date
  - Download and parse sessions from workflow logs
  - Handle structured filenames with metadata

related_tools:
  - fetch_logs.py (separate tool, not part of xs core)
