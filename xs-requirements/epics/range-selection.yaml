range_syntax:
  - "5" - single item at index 5
  - "+10" - first 10 items
  - "-20" - last 20 items
  - "10-30" - items 10 through 30

pipeline_position: |
  Per filtering_pipeline_design.md:
  Load -> Filter -> Order -> Slice -> Display

  Positional ranges operate on timeline BEFORE filtering.
  Proposed --head/--tail would operate AFTER filtering.

  Search day logs for:
  - "range", "index", "indices"
  - "+10", "-20", "10-30"
  - "first", "last", "slice"
  - "head", "tail"

  Focus on discussions about range-filter interaction.
